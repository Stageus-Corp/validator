# üöÄ @stagues/validator

You can use @stageus/validator to validate different types of data.

@stagues/valdiator allows you to transform or validate not only string type but also various types of data.

# Installation

```
npm install @stageus/validator
```

# ‚úèÔ∏è Usage

This library provides validation for Type as well as Boolean, Date, Number, String, Array, NumberArray, and StringArray types.

Firstly, a function called 'message' provides Type validation. Here, you can validate the type and use the basic utility method for validation. Once the type of data to be validated is confirmed, you can define and use the method to validate the type through each type validation method in a chaining manner.

```typescript
import { message } from '@stageus/validator';

const emailValdiator = message().isString().isEmail();

const result = emailValdiator.run('abc123@xx.xx');

result.valid; // true
result.message; // null
result.value; // abc123@xx.xx

const result2 = emailValidator.run('abc123');
result.valid; // false
result.message; // Value is not email format
result.value; // abc123
```

# üìÑ Document

### Function

You can use the "Type" validation method through the function named 'message'. The Type validation method can be confirmed through the document below.

```typescript
message(). // then you can use Type method
```

## üîß Type Method

| Method Name      | Return  | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| optional()       | Type    | In case of null or undefined, the chaining method is ignored and the validation result is set to true.                                                                                |
| default(value)   | Type    | If the value is null or undefined, it is validated with the value put as the first parameter.                                                                                         |
| isNumber(option) | Number  | It checks if the input value is of type number. By default, numbers entered as a string are also allowed, but if the `strict` option is set to true, all strings fail the validation. |
| isArray()        | Array   | It checks if it is an array type.                                                                                                                                                     |
| isString(option) | String  | It checks if it is a string type. By default, only strings are allowed, but if `allowNumber` is set to true, it also converts numbers to strings and passes the validation.           |
| isBoolean()      | Boolean | It checks if it is a boolean type. By default, only true or false pass the validation, but if the strict option is set to true, "true", "false", 0, and 1 also pass the validation.   |
| isDate()         | Date    | It checks whether the input value can be converted to a Date object. If the input value is a string, it should basically follow the ISO8061 format.                                   |
| isEmpty()        |         | It checks if it is empty. Since this method only checks whether it is empty, you cannot use more validation method chaining.                                                          |
